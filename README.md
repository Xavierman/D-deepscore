### Introduction
In this paper, we proposed the D-deepscore, which could quickly and accurately evaluate models from different source domains on a target domain, and then select the source domain model without any
fine-tuning process.

To validate the accuracy of D-deepscore in evaluating the transfer performance of pre-trained models, we tested D-deepscore on various image datasets and analyzed the evaluation scores against the accuracy of the models after training. The results showed a high degree of consistency between the evaluation curves and the model accuracy.

### Experimental Steps
### Step 1: Obtaining the pre-trained model
There are two ways to obtain pre-trained models. One is to pre-train the selected model using your own dataset, and the other is to obtain the official pre-trained model.
### Step 2: Extraction of transfer features
We extract the feature information from the conv4_x layer of the ResNet18 pre-trained model as representation information, and then D-deepscore uses the representation information and target data to obtain the evaluation score.
### D-deepscore code  
Run transfer_feature.py to obtain the representation information of the pre-trained model.  
Run D-deepscore to obtain evaluation scores and rankings for multiple pre-trained models.
